                    <p>This is the video I submitted for the 2014 Google Teacher Academy in Austin, Texas. This is a good representation of what I do as a Technology Educator at SBHS and also displays my skills in video editing. Although I was not selected, this is something I worked very hard on and am quite proud of! =)</p>

                    <p>This Google Site, which is created and maintained be and the other SBHS Tech Educator, is used at SBHS for many purposes. This includes making a reservation for a Chromecart - a cart of 30 Chromebooks to be used in a classroom - and making a reservation for the Digital Learning Center - a larger learning space for teachers to bring their classes and use a chromebox that connects to a projector. Their are also tutorials and news, many of which are written by me, that include screenshots and videos of all the technology we want our staff to use which includes Google Drive, Chromebooks, and many other educational and productivity web tools.</p>

                    <p>This is my class wiki which I use daily for all of my classes. Here students, parents, teachers, and administrators can find my daily agenda to see what I a covering each day in class. Students access it as soon as they come in to class and are able to get started with their work without being told. All resources students need can also be accessed here which inludes links to articles, videos, Google Documents for worksheets, Google Forms for quizzes and tests, and even the website I designed to be my ebook for my web design classes.</p>

                    <p>This is the "ebook" I use in both my Introduction to Web Design and Web Animation courses. Students use this site daily to learn how to create and host sites for free using their Google Drive accounts. This site also has written and video tutorials where they learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I am constantly updating this site to make it better and more enjoyable for students to learn from.</p>
