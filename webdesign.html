            Web Design is a deep passion of mine and I strive to learn more and more each day. Currently my skills include:

              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>

                <p><b>Learn Web Design</b> - This is the "ebook" I use in both my Introduction to Web Design and Web Animation courses. Students use this site daily to learn the how to create and host sites for free using their Google Drive accounts. This site also has written and video tutorials where they learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. I am constantly updating this site to make it better and more enjoyable for students to learn from.</p>

                <p><b>Wedding Web App</b> - This web app was sent to the guests of my wedding to make the day go as smooth as possible. Launching the app starts with a tour of the site. Navigation directions to both the ceremony and reception launch any smartphone's default map application with the click of a button. Information is also given on the Filipino and Chinese wedding traditions as well as pictures of the bridal party. Two iMovies are also featured - one of our engagement pictures and the other is our save the date video. Finally app and browser links to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram make it easy for our guests to post pictures along with the wedding hashtag to make it simple to view everyone's pictures. Although this is meant to be viewed on a smartphone it still looks equally as elegant on a desktop browser.</p>

              <p><b>Viking Tech</b> - This is a prototype of the Technology Educator website for SBHS. It is a site for all teachers and staff of SBHS as well as the SB school district to find tutorials on all the technology we use including Google Drive, Chromebooks, Mac, and iOS devices. This site also has other essential links that staff use regularly. This site eventually lead to the creation of the Google Site  Tech Talk at SBHS which can be found on my <a href="teched.html">Tech Ed</a> page.</p>
